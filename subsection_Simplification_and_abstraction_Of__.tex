\subsection{Simplification and abstraction}

Of course, as with all modelling approaches also NGO is about simplification and abstraction. As Turing said in the introduction of his famous paper on morphogenesis [Turing1952], a model is a simplification and idealization, and consequently a falsification. However, a good model has interesting features that help us critically evaluate our current state of knowledge.  [ADD SOMETHING ON HOW TO MAKE SIMPLIFICATIONS / ABSTRACTIONS? SHOULD THAT BE ITS OWN `GUIDELINEâ€™ IN NGO APPROACH?]
