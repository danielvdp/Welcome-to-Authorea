\subsection{Limits of hypothesis-driven and knowledge creation via `expectation violation'}

Ironically however, learning from conceptual models often precedes hypothesis testing precisely because the  ideal of hypothesis-driven research fails in practice. Already before any hypothesis is tested, it is often found that models and simulations do not match the modellersâ€™ baseline expectations (or experimental data). It is in those moments that we start learning something truly new. Instead of testing a hypothesis, the models expose gaps in our knowledge and assumptions, enable us to generate new questions, or even enable us to suggest a novel way of conceptualizing  a biological phenomenon.
