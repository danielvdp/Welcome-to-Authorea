\subsection{Harnessing the knowledge creation side of models: NGO}

Such pre-hypothesis `lessons' from conceptual models are often treated as side-effects of modelling.  Here we argue it could and should be one of the focal points of modelling. To do so, we advocate an (under-appreciated) approach to modelling that places the above mentioned side-effects at center-stage and hence maximizes the potential for discovery (i.e. learning novelty). In line with previous work, we call the approach ``non-goal oriented'' (NGO) [Hogeweg]. Since there is no goal, `side-effects' become `main effects'.  By NGO we therefore mean: studying the dynamics of models in its most unbiased form possible. In what follows, we address the exploratory, and open-ended nature of NGO modelling, its relevance, and how it complements other modelling philosophies.
