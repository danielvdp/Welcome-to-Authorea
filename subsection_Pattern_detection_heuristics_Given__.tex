\subsection{Pattern-detection heuristics}

Given the exploratory nature of NGO models, a natural way to analyse their outcomes is by using unsupervised pattern detection methods like hierarchical clustering, principal component analysis. Graphical visualization of dynamics is also often indispensible, as well as taylored-made heuristics that can be formulated once some hypotheses about the dynamics have been generated, i.e. once interesting patterns have been discovered, analysis proceeds very much in a hypothesis-driven way. This may seem inconsistent, but the important point is that the initial model dynamics are not derived in a hypothesis-driven fashion.
