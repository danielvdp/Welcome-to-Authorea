\subsection{Similarity to other approaches}

Biology has always been a field of study that focuses on whole systems, whether they are ecosystems, organisms, cells, or protein complexes (just to name a few). It is only in the last two decades that we have been able to measure...


many of the above mentioned features of NGO models have become popular in a subfield of system biology, where one describes a system and its dynamics at a specific spatial and temporal level by defining it in terms of the components at a lower level [LeNovere]. An important difference between NGO and such system biology models is that often system biology models test specific hypotheses. 

With the increasing computational power, another popular approach is to enumerate all variants of a biological system and explore their behaviour. This exploration of an atlas of a given system is basically NGO exploiting modern day technological possibilities.
