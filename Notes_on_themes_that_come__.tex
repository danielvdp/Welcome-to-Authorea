Notes on themes that come up in the text (hopefully making them explicit will help to clarify things):
\begin{enumerate}
\item Formal models and types of questions: in parts of the text it seems that we are arguing that certain kinds of models are good for certain kinds of questions.
\item Formal models and understanding the world: our underlying theme is that we use models to understand the world around us. This involves answering different kinds of questions and making scientific discoveries. NGO models typically apply to the latter, and are useful for exploring `possible worlds'.
\item Formal models and hypotheses: an NGO approach tends not to have a specific hypothesis (i.e. not hypothesis-driven), but is exploratory and unsupervised. However, often formal models are formulated in order to assess an existing hypothesis (hypothesis-driven). We argue that hypothesis-driven research is biased to preconceived ideas (underlying assumptions). There are two extreme reactions to this: (i) hypothesis-driven research is fine, but we should double-check our assumptions, and (ii) in the face of biological complexity, our preconception are almost certainly flawed and hypothesis-driven research is erroneously biased. In either case, NGO can help us further.
\item Formal models and scientific discovery: formal models can lead to scientific discovery when they lead to new insights about how certain phenomena can arise (e.g. proofs of principle). This is where our understanding of reality is `put on trial', and models help us elucidate counter-intuitive dynamics that cannot be thought-through very easily. NGO models can help us to make such discoveries.
