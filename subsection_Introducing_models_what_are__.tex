\subsection{Introducing models: what are models \& models are important}

Modelling and simulation are tools to better understand the world around us [Lander2010, Tyson2015, Stanford Encyclopedia]. Computational, theoretical, and philosophically-inclined biologists agree on this.  It is becoming clear that modelling and simulation are indispensable in advancing biology. One only needs to think of the myriad of pattern analysis algorithms in the various omics disciplines; the statistical and evolutionary models used in phylogenetics and phylogenomics; the strong tradition of mathematical models in behaviour, ecology, and evolution; and the dynamic models in systems and synthetic biology. The increasing relevance of models and simulations is also reflected in the development of user-friendly software that assist the non-expert, e.g. [cite Netlogo, Copasi, Cytoscape, CompuCell, and MatCont for Matlab].
